**NEAR next stage criteria:**

Like most token-holders we are keen to move to the next stage as soon as possible, however it is a major step and should not be undertaken without a proper risk assessment, lest it turn out to be a step off a cliff!

Such a risk assessment would be informed by a set of “gate” criteria, such as those developed and published on Github by Viktor Bunin of Bison Trails (https://github.com/nearprotocol/NEPs/issues/115).

We support these and request that they are augmented by the following additional criteria:

* Confidence in decentralised governance capability
* Clear fall-back option/position
* Effective restart process
* Red alerts practiced and proven
* Mainnet validators to ensure they are using the same processes across both testnet and mainnet (to ensure testnet is a valid proving ground for our mainnet procedures).

The first of these additional criteria is probably the  most fundamental. Moving to decentralised control means just that, no one has authority. The way in which decentralised governance will be established and operated should be as clear as we can make it before we make this step. 

Whatever criteria are ultimately jointly agreed should have defined standards for being complete, evidence of completion and ideally assessment of status which is as objective as possible. We support the initiative to reach joint agreement on these gate criteria and the proposal to publish progress measures against the criteria.
